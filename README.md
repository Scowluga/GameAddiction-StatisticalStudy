<h1>What makes a repetitve game addicting?</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>With the age of smart phones, a trend has appeared in the gaming world: one of short, repetitve, and addictive games. What makes these games so successful? Does a game's difficulty affect it's replayability? How about the presence of a high score?</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis: </strong><u>A game without a high score, or benchmark to beat, will quickly become mundane and the player will lose interest. Likewise, if the game is too hard, or too easy, they will quickly lose interest and stop playing.</u></p>
<h3>Study</h3>
<p>Data will be collected from this short interactive survey: a website followed by a prepopulated Google form. </p>
<p>The data will then be analyzed using a variety of techniques. </p>
